            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Daniel Ildefonso I am a student that goes to Philip J. Patino School of entrepreneurship. I am pretty normal when it comes to school standards just get good grades and I’ll get by with my mom. I don’t worry about much not even projects affect me too much I just do it because if you think about it too much you can get affected by stress. My personal hobbies are building computers learning C++ and playing videogames sometimes working out too.</p>
            <p>All I want to do is start a company for private investigations because all I ask for in life is to help people. As far as college goes I just need it enough to go through a police academy and become a detective or learn investigation techniques. I don’t want to have a lot in life if anything the only luxurious item I want in life is a 1986 Impala. My goals at first seem simple but I will work hard for them.</p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <h3>Long term goal</h3>
                    <p>Well to start off with my long term goal I have to say that I really want to do something that my parents have been wanting me to do that my siblings have always struggled with. This is high school a concept that my siblings had trouble grasping and lost focus in and so I want to prove to my parents that I can stay focus in high school. This school is a very good opportunity because I am working towards a job and running a business while finishing high school. I do not want to disappoint my mom especially considering she has been building me up to become successful as her last child and I will work to become what she envisions me.
                    In short I must graduate high school without the drama and distractions that come along with it. I will continue to rise up and start a business. I will help people with my business and make my mother proud and rise up in my prime until the very end. I promised to keeping doing good even if life beats me down and all though I think I will burn out at some point I’m okay with it just need to take some things slow.
                    </p>
                <h3>Short term goal</h3>
                    <p>My short term goal right now is very easy in my book compared to others considering I want to do a lot of things in life already. Although school might get in the way of it I really want to make Gold V in League of Legends a game I play at home with some internet friends. The reason why I say school might get in the way is because well games sometimes take 50 minutes each time I play one and I have to play multiple to reach where I need to be. School takes up about 7 hours of the day so I have to work around that but I can work it out somehow.
                	Another one is easily stay up with grades and get Bullard off of my back about this unpaid fine that I recently paid back. Off topic really just do more than expected as my mom always says to me. In my head it is all easy and figured out on keeping up with grades. Just finding the right time to execute a day where I do all of my homework and work in general is okay.

                <h3>Personal </h3>
                <p>I recently have been fixing up my own car because I feel I desperately need one right now but I might not need one as bad as I think. I think this would give me a sense of freedom but it might not it might just screw with me and give me stress. I have for the past 2 weeks been fixing up a Toyota which saves a lot on gas and has a pretty good engine. Although it is not necessarily my dream car it is a pretty good one. That’s my personal goal is to fix it to its best.</p>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                <p>	Well back to what I was saying earlier I need to keep my grades up to keep my mom proud of me and so by doing that I have been doing this since 6th grade never getting an F on any subjects. I even have rewards to prove it but I don’t like to brag really about it just as long as I have A’s I’m okay with everything. I keeping my grades up also mean I get accepted into schools faster and maybe even college. This is all really an accomplishment for educational purposes but maybe personal reasons also it’s just good to have A’s on your report cards.</p>
